# Spoty-rank
A Django project where i use the spotify-api i'm still thinking about what to do, for now the idea is to use the popularity of each of your 20 last songs
to get the avg then this will be how tunned you are to the trendings, this will give you a profile like "You are Trend" if you get 90-100
or "You are so Underground" for something between 0-20 popularity.

The project is done in a django folder as i'm still thinking if it will have a front end framework/library (wich i think it's probably react),
this way i can start to learn it 

When the project is ready this readme is going to be changed
